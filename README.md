# How Microsoft KMS Servers Work

Microsoft Key Management Service (KMS) is a feature that allows organizations to activate Windows operating systems and Office products on their network without contacting Microsoft servers. KMS is part of the Microsoft Volume Activation 2.0 solution that was introduced with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

KMS works by using a client-server model, where a KMS host (server) holds a special key called the KMS host key, which is obtained from Microsoft through volume licensing. The KMS host then activates itself with Microsoft servers over the internet or by phone. Once activated, the KMS host can activate other computers on the network that are running Windows or Office products that support volume activation.

The computers that connect to the KMS host for activation are called KMS clients. They do not need individual product keys, as they use a generic volume license key (GVLK) that is embedded in their software. By default, all volume editions of Windows and Office are configured as KMS clients. The KMS clients periodically contact the KMS host to renew their activation status. If they fail to contact the KMS host for a certain period of time (180 days for Windows and 30 days for Office), they enter a reduced functionality mode until they can reactivate.

To create a KMS host, an administrator needs to install the Volume Activation Services role on a Windows Server computer and enter the KMS host key for their organization. The administrator can then configure various settings for the KMS host, such as activation thresholds, port number, DNS publishing, firewall rules, etc. The administrator can also monitor and manage the activation status of the KMS clients using tools such as slmgr.vbs, Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT), Event Viewer, etc.

KMS is a flexible and scalable solution for activating Windows and Office products in large organizations. It reduces the administrative overhead of managing individual product keys and provides better security and compliance than other methods of activation. However, it also requires careful planning and maintenance to ensure that the KMS host is always available and updated with new keys when needed.
